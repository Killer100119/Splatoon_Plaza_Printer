Introduction: 
  This is a hacking project with the objective of using an original Nintendo Switch controller via relays.
  The original focus was printing photos and automating drawings on the Splatoon 2 & 3 plaza, since it can be done with fewer buttons.
  However with few code modifications it can be used for other applications.

TODO:
  -Readme
  -Polish .ino file
  -QoL improvements (Custom file name, ETA counter... )
  -Tutorial of how to install and execute (With photos preferably)
